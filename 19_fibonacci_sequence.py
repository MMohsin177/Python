is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.

ðŸ’¡ Example Breakdown:

Term(n)	  Fibonacci Number	   How It Was Calculated
0	           0	                (Starting value)
1	           1                 	(Starting value)
2	        0 + 1 = 1	       Previous two terms: 0 and 1
3	        1 + 1 = 2	       Previous two terms: 1 and 1
4        	1 + 2 = 3	       Previous two terms: 1 and 2
5	        2 + 3 = 5	       Previous two terms: 2 and 3"""
